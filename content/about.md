Hello, and welcome to my blog site. This is a static site hosted in GitHub pages, so as far as the privacy policy, I am not collecting any of your information. GitHub may log details about your site visit.

I work as a SOC Lead and have been in Cybersecurity for 5 years. Previously I worked at an MSP developing a customer-facing MSSP solution, and currently I am working in a company's internal SOC. Prior to these I held various support roles. My active certifications are (As of 7/1/23):

* CompTIA: A+, Network+, Security+, Linux+, CySA+, Pentest+, CASP+
* Microsoft: Azure Administrator Associate, Azure Security Engineer Associate, Microsoft Identity and Access Administrator
* Google: Google Cloud Associate Cloud Engineer, Google Cloud Security Engineer
* AWS: Certified Cloud Practicioner
* GIAC: GCIA, GOSI, GPCS, GCSA

This blog has a couple of purposes:

* Record learning efforts on off-time. Most of these will have the designation "LAB -" to indicate that they're not present for a whole lot other than to record my efforts learning and tinkering with tings.
* Informative. Somewhere between sharing knowledge of tools, applications, or systems, and providing some insight based upon what I've witnessed in the industry.
